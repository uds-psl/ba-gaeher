# Towards a Formal Proof of the Cook-Levin Theorem 

This contains Lennard Gäher's Bachelor's thesis at the [Programming Systems Lab](https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/) of [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/).

## How to build

### Required packages

You need `Coq 8.8.1` or `8.8.2` built on OCAML `> 4.02.3` and the [Equations](https://mattam82.github.io/Coq-Equations/) package for Coq. If you're using opam 2 you can use the following commands to install the dependencies on a new switch:

```
opam switch create coq-library-undecidability 4.07.1+flambda
eval $(opam env)
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam update
opam install . --deps-only
```

### Build external libraries

The Undecidability libraries depends on several external libraries. Initialise and build them once as follows:

``` sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
make deps
```

### Building the undecidability library

- `make all` builds the library
- `make html` generates clickable coqdoc `.html` in the `website` subdirectory
- `make clean` removes all build files in `theories` and `.html` files in the `website` directory
- `make realclean` also removes all build files in the `external` directory. You have to run `make deps` again after this.

Use `make all -j[#cores * 2]` to speed up compilation if you have enough RAM. For compilation with 8 threads or more, about 8-10GB RAM are needed. Minimum RAM needed is ~5GB.
This should take about 1-2 hours, depending on the speed of your system.

## Thesis
The source code of the thesis is located in `tex/thesis`. Build it with `make`. 
A PDF can be downloaded [here](https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~gaeher/files/thesis-gaeher.pdf). 

## Acknowledgements
The main definitions of NP and poly-time reductions were developed by [Fabian Kunze](https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~kunze/); this includes all files in the `theories/L/Complexity/` folder except for the ones listed above.

The Coq notation definitions for the option monad in file `theories/L/Complexity/MorePrelim.v` have been taken from [Thomas Strathmann's blog post](https://pdp7.org/blog/2011/01/the-maybe-monad-in-coq/). 

The file `theories/L/Complexity/Reductions/pigeonhole.v` contains a proof of the pigeonhole principle adapted from the [ICL 2019 lecture](https://courses.ps.uni-saarland.de/icl_19/2/Resources). 

Please also read the Acknowledgements section of the thesis.
